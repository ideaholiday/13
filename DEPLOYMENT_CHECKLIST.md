## Deployment Options

### Option A: Direct Deployment (Recommended) âš¡
```bash
# 1. Build frontend
cd ih-frontend
npm install  # (if needed)
npm run build

# 2. Deploy built files
# Deploy to your hosting/server
```

### Option B: Staged Rollout
```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging
# 2. Test with real TBO data
# 3. Monitor for issues
# 4. Deploy to production
```

### Option C: Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
# 1. Build new version with fix
# 2. Deploy to green environment
# 3. Run smoke tests
# 4. Switch traffic from blue to green
# 5. Keep blue as rollback
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Restore previous version of file
git checkout HEAD~1 -- ih-frontend/src/components/flights/flight-search-results.tsx

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
```

### Full Rollback (Automatic)
- Rollback point: Previous commit before this fix
- Time estimate: 5-10 minutes
- Risk level: **VERY LOW** (simple file revert)

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate (0-5 minutes)
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] No 500 errors in logs
- [ ] Console shows no critical errors
- [ ] Flight search page accessible

### Short-term (5-30 minutes)
- [ ] Search DEL â†’ BOM displays real flights
- [ ] Airline names are real (not "Unknown Airline")
- [ ] Flight numbers are real (not "XX000")
- [ ] Times are real (not "NaN NaN")
- [ ] Prices are real (not "â‚¹0")

### Long-term (30+ minutes)
- [ ] Monitor error rates - should be stable
- [ ] Check performance metrics - should be unchanged
- [ ] Verify user engagement - should increase
- [ ] No bug reports about flight display

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Error Rate** - Should remain < 0.1%
2. **Page Load Time** - Should be unchanged (Â±5%)
3. **User Interactions** - Should increase (more flight selections)
4. **Bounce Rate** - Should decrease (more relevant results)
5. **Conversion Rate** - Should increase (better data displayed)

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate > 1% â†’ **INVESTIGATE**
- Page load time > 110% of baseline â†’ **INVESTIGATE**
- Unusual traffic pattern â†’ **CHECK LOGS**

---
