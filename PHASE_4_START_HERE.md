## 📊 Pricing Calculation

### Formula
```
Base Fare = (Flight fare per person × number of passengers)
Taxes = Base Fare × 15%
Add-ons = Sum of all add-on items with quantities
Subtotal = Base Fare + Taxes
After Discount = Subtotal - Promo Discount
Total = After Discount + Add-ons
Per Person = Total ÷ Number of Passengers
```

### Example
```
3 Adult Passengers
Outbound Flight: ₹5,000/person

Base Fare: ₹15,000 (5,000 × 3)
Taxes (15%): ₹2,250
Add-ons: ₹2,500 (2kg baggage × 3 + meals)
Promo Discount: -₹500

Total: ₹19,250 (displayed prominently in sidebar)
Per Person: ₹6,417
```

## 📞 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Payment form shows errors
**Solution:** Check that all required fields are filled. Card number must be 16 digits, expiry MM/YY format, CVV 3-4 digits.

**Problem:** Promo code not applying
**Solution:** Use demo codes: SAVE100, SAVE500, WELCOME20, or EARLY50. In production, backend validates against database.

**Problem:** Can't proceed to payment
**Solution:** Ensure all passengers and seats were selected in Phase 3. Go back to Phase 3 if incomplete.

**Problem:** Navigation back doesn't work
**Solution:** Use "Back to Selection" button in header to return to Phase 3.
