# Flight Search 400 Error Fix

## Issue
The flight search results page was showing a "Request failed with status code 400" error when users tried to search for flights.

## Root Cause
The validation in `/api/air/search/route.ts` was expecting dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` (ISO datetime format), but the URL parameters were providing dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (date only format).

## Changes Made

### 1. **ih-frontend/src/app/flights/results/page.tsx**
   - Added date formatting helper function to convert date strings to proper format
   - Dates are now formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` before being sent to the API
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Improved error handling to show validation errors

### 2. **ih-frontend/src/app/api/air/search/route.ts**
   - Added detailed logging in validation function
   - Enhanced validation to check date format
   - Improved error messages to show actual values received
   - Added validation for datetime format

## Technical Details

### Date Format Issue
- **Before**: URL had `depart=2025-11-02`
- **After**: API receives `departDate=2025-11-02T00:00:00`

### Validation Improvements
- Now shows exactly what values were received when validation fails
- Validates datetime format matches ISO 8601 standard
- Better error messages for debugging

### Error Display Improvements
- Results page now shows the actual validation error message
- Added proper error state handling
- Better user experience with clearer error messages

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to `/flights/results?from=DEL&to=BOM&depart=2025-11-02&adults=1&children=0&infants=0&cabin=E`
2. The page should now successfully make the API request without a 400 error
3. Check browser console for detailed logging

## Files Modified
- `ih-frontend/src/app/flights/results/page.tsx` - Date formatting and error handling
- `ih-frontend/src/app/api/air/search/route.ts` - Validation improvements and logging
