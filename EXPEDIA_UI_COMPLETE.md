# Expedia-Style Flight UI - Complete Implementation ✅

## Overview
Successfully transformed the flight search and results pages to **production-grade Expedia-style UI** with comprehensive flight information including SSR (Special Service Requests), meals, baggage, seats, and fare rules.

---

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **Flight Search Page** (`src/app/flights/page.tsx`)
**Before:** Simple gradient background with minimal design
**After:** Professional Expedia-style hero section with:
- ✅ Bold blue gradient hero banner (matching Expedia branding)
- ✅ Floating search widget card (elevated with shadow)
- ✅ Benefits section with 4 trust points (Best Price, Security, Support, Instant Confirmation)
- ✅ Stats section showing (500+ Airlines, 1M+ Daily Flights, 190+ Countries, 24/7 Support)
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Hero background with decorative SVG wave patterns
- Elevated search card with -20px margin-top (overlaps hero)
- Glass effect on benefit cards with hover animations
- Professional typography hierarchy

### 2. **Normalized Flight Data** (`src/lib/normalizeFlights.ts`)
**Enhanced Data Model** - Added 7 new fields to `NormalizedItinerary`:

```typescript
// New Interfaces
interface SegmentDetail { }
interface FareRuleDetail { type, details, days, charges }
interface SsrOption { type, description, price, included }

// New Fields in NormalizedItinerary
baggage: string                    // e.g., "15 KG", "20 KG"
cabinBaggage: string              // e.g., "7 KG", "Included"
seatAvailable: number             // Real-time seat count
fareRules: FareRuleDetail[]        // Extracted from MiniFareRules
ssrOptions: SsrOption[]            // Meals, Seats, Baggage options
isFreeMealAvailable: boolean       // Flag for free meals
isBookableIfSeatNotAvailable: bool // Booking policy flag
```

**Data Extraction Logic:**
- Extracts baggage from first segment
- Parses MiniFareRules into human-readable format
- Builds SSR options from IsFreeMealAvailable flag
- Captures real-time seat availability
- Maps CabinClass to readable names (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First)

### 3. **Flight Card Component** (`src/components/flights/FlightCardExpedia.tsx`)
**Transformed to Full-Featured Card:**

#### Main Section (Always Visible):
- Airline logo icon (blue background)
- Flight time, duration, and stops info
- Three-column layout: Airline | Route | Amenities | Price
- Smart badges for Refundable, Meals, LCC status
- Quick expand/collapse button + Select button

#### Expandable Details Section (Click to Expand):
Shows three-column grid:

**Column 1: Baggage**
- ✅ Checked baggage allowance
- ✅ Cabin baggage allowance

**Column 2: Seats & Availability**
- ✅ Available seat count
- ✅ Bookable if sold out info

**Column 3: Services**
- ✅ Meal availability status
- ✅ Free meal indicator

**Additional Section:**
- **Fare Rules** - All applicable rules (Cancellation, Reissue, Refund, Date Change)
- Each rule shows type, details, and timeframe

**Visual Design:**
- Card-based layout with border and hover effects
- Icons for each section (Briefcase for baggage, Armchair for seats, Utensils for meals)
- Color-coded badges (green for refundable, amber for meals, orange for LCC)
- Smooth expand/collapse animation
- Gray background for details section for visual separation

### 4. **Performance Optimizations** (Previously Applied)
✅ React Query cache strategy (1 hour staleTime & gcTime)
✅ useMemo for instant filtering in ResultsList
✅ React.memo for FlightCard to prevent unnecessary re-renders
