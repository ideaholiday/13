## What's New

Your Idea Holiday platform now has **production-ready AI voice search** that works across the entire website!

### ✨ Key Features

1. **🌐 Global Voice Search** (Floating Button)
   - Bottom-right corner on all pages
   - Search flights, hotels, packages, and content
   - Smart intent detection routes to correct pages
   - Beautiful animated UI with voice feedback

2. **✈️ In-Form Voice Search** (Flight Form)
   - Microphone button in flight search form

   - Context-aware for better accuracy

3. **🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence**
   - Uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription (multi-language)
   - GPT-4 for intent parsing and entity extraction
   - Fallback to mock mode if no API key

4. **🗣️ Multi-Language Support**
   - English, Hindi, Hinglish
   - Voice output speaks responses back
   - Natural language understanding

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get API Key (Optional but Recommended)

**Option A: OpenAI (Best Quality)**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up and create API key
3. Copy the key

**Option B: Skip for Now (Uses Mock Data)**
- Works out of the box with sample responses
- Good for testing the UI/UX
- No external API calls

### Step 2: Configure Environment

```bash
cd ih-frontend
```

Edit `.env.local` and add (if using OpenAI):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

### Step 3: Test It!

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Open http://localhost:3010
2. Click the **floating microphone button** (bottom-right)
3. Grant microphone permission
4. Speak: **"Find flights from Delhi to Dubai next week"**
5. Watch it auto-search! 🎉

## 📝 Example Queries

### Flights
- "Find flights from Delhi to Dubai next week"
- "Show me one-way flights from Mumbai to London"
- "Round trip from Delhi to New York in business class"

### Hotels
- "Find hotels in Paris for next weekend"
- "Show me 5-star hotels in Dubai"
- "Book a hotel in London for 3 nights"

### Packages
- "Dubai holiday packages"
- "5-day tour to Bali"
- "Honeymoon packages to Maldives"

### General
- "What are your cancellation policies?"
- "Show my bookings"
- "How do I change my booking?"

## 🎯 How It Works

```
User speaks → Browser captures audio → API transcribes (Whisper) 
→ GPT extracts intent & entities → Routes to correct page 
→ Auto-fills form → Triggers search → Speaks result
```

## 📁 Files Added/Modified

### New Files
1. `/src/app/api/voice-search/route.ts` - AI API integration
2. `/src/components/shared/GlobalVoiceSearch.tsx` - Floating search button
3. `/VOICE_SEARCH_SETUP.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files
1. `/src/components/shared/VoiceSearchButton.tsx` - Enhanced with AI
2. `/src/components/flights/flight-search-form-simple.tsx` - Added context
3. `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added GlobalVoiceSearch
4. `/.env.local` - Added OPENAI_API_KEY

## 🔧 Configuration

### Mock Mode (Development)
- No API key needed
- Returns sample data
- Perfect for UI testing
- Zero cost

### Production Mode (OpenAI)
- Requires API key
- Real transcription & understanding
- Multi-language support
- Cost: ~$0.01 per query

### Cost Estimation
- 1,000 queries/month = ~$10
- 10,000 queries/month = ~$100
- Free tier: 1,000 queries (OpenAI trial)

## 🎨 UI Components

### Global Voice Search Dialog
- Full-screen modal with animations
- Voice visualizer during recording
- Processing indicator
- Success feedback with route preview
- Example queries help text

### In-Form Voice Button
- Compact icon button
- Inline status indicators
- Auto-fill and trigger search
- Context-aware (knows it's for flights)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ Requires user permission for microphone
- ✅ Audio sent via HTTPS
- ✅ Not stored anywhere
- ✅ Processed and discarded immediately
- ✅ OpenAI API is secure and compliant

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Microphone not working"
- Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
- Must use HTTPS (or localhost for dev)
- Try refreshing page

### "Voice processing failed"
- Check API key in .env.local
- Verify OpenAI account has credits
- System will fallback to mock mode automatically

### "No search results"
- Voice recognized but didn't trigger search?
- Check browser console for errors
- Try more specific queries: "Find flights from [city] to [city] on [date]"

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Add New Intents

Edit `/src/app/api/voice-search/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Add to GPT system prompt
Supported intents: ..., your_new_intent

// Add routing in GlobalVoiceSearch.tsx
case 'your_new_intent':
  router.push('/your-page')
  break
```

### Customize Responses

Edit mock responses in `/src/app/api/voice-search/route.ts`:
```typescript
function mockVoiceResponse(context: string) {
  // Customize responses here
}
```

### Multi-Language

The system auto-detects language:
- Whisper transcribes in any language
- GPT understands Hindi/English/Hinglish
- Speech output matches input language

## 📊 Analytics (Future Enhancement)

Track voice search usage:
```typescript
// In voice-search/route.ts
await analytics.track('voice_search', {
  intent: result.intent,
  language: detected_lang,
  success: true
})
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Add env var in Vercel dashboard
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Other Platforms
Ensure environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in deployment settings.

## 🎉 What's Next?

Your voice search is live! Users can now:

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test with mock first** - No setup needed, works immediately
2. **Grant mic permission** - Browser will ask once
3. **Speak clearly** - Pause for 1 second after speaking
4. **Be specific** - "Delhi to Dubai next week" works better than "flights"
5. **Check console** - Errors show up in browser dev tools
