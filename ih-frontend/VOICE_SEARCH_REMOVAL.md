## What Was Voice Search?

The voice search feature was an AI-powered voice interface that allowed users to:
- Search for flights, hotels, and packages using voice commands
- Ask questions about website services, policies, and contact info
- Get responses in English, Hindi, or Hinglish (multi-language support)
- Auto-fill search forms based on voice input

### Technology Stack (Removed)
- **OpenAI Whisper API** - Speech-to-text transcription
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - Intent parsing and Q&A
- **Web Speech API** - Browser-based speech recognition (fallback)
- **MediaRecorder API** - Audio recording

## Reason for Removal

Per user request: "i think we are failed to integrate voice serch, so removed voice buttion- all"

The integration was not working as expected, so all voice search functionality has been completely removed from the codebase.

## Clean State Verification

✅ **No Compilation Errors** - All voice search references removed
✅ **No Import Errors** - All unused imports cleaned up  
✅ **Components Deleted** - VoiceSearchButton and GlobalVoiceSearch removed
✅ **API Route Deleted** - Voice search endpoint removed
✅ **Types Cleaned** - VoiceSearchResult interface removed
✅ **Hooks Cleaned** - useVoiceSearch hook removed
✅ **Documentation Archived** - All voice search docs moved to `archive/`

## Search Button Restored

The flight search form now has a single, clean search button:

```tsx
<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Button
    onClick={handleSearch}
    size="lg"
    className="bg-gradient-to-r from-ruby-600 to-ruby-700 hover:from-ruby-700 hover:to-ruby-800 px-12 py-3 text-lg font-semibold"
  >
    <Plane className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" />
    Search Flights
  </Button>
</div>
```

## Archived Files Location

All voice search documentation has been moved to:
```
ih-frontend/archive/
├── VOICE_SEARCH_COMPLETE.md
├── VOICE_SEARCH_SETUP.md
├── VOICE_SEARCH_FIXES.md
└── VOICE_SEARCH_QUICKREF.txt
```

These files can be referenced if voice search needs to be re-implemented in the future.
